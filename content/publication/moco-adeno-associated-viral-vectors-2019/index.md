abstract: Immunotherapy with T cells expressing chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) is
  an emerging and promising treatment against refractory cancers. However, the currently
  adopted methods of modification of T cells pose a risk of insertional oncogenesis
  because lentiviral and retroviral vectors integrate the CAR transgene in a semi-random
  fashion. In addition, this therapy is only available using autologous cells, which
  create problems in production and limit the access for patients who had their T
  cells depleted. One modification method that shows the ability to overcome both
  drawbacks is the knock-in of the CAR simultaneously knocking-out genes that prevent
  allogeneic therapy, such as the endogenous T cell receptor. In this mini-review,
  we present recent efforts to develop safer universal CAR-T cells. More specifically,
  we focus on the combined application of target-directed nucleases, which create
  a double-strand break at a specific genome locus, and the delivery of CAR DNA via
  adeno-associated viral vectors for subsequent integration via homologous recombination
  and silencing of the targeted gene. This article is protected by copyright. All
