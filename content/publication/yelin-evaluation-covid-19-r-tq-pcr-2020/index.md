abstract: 'BACKGROUND: The recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2 lead to a current pandemic
  of unprecedented scale. Though diagnostic tests are fundamental to the ability to
  detect and respond, overwhelmed healthcare systems are already experiencing shortages
  of reagents associated with this test, calling for a lean immediately-applicable
  protocol. METHODS: RNA extracts of positive samples were tested for the presence
  of SARS-CoV-2 using RT-qPCR, alone or in pools of different sizes (2-, 4-, 8- ,16-,
  32- and 64-sample pools) with negative samples. Transport media of additional 3
  positive samples were also tested when mixed with transport media of negative samples
  in pools of 8. RESULTS: A single positive sample can be detected in pools of up
  to 32 samples, using the standard kits and protocols, with an estimated false negative
  rate of 10%. Detection of positive samples diluted in even up to 64 samples may
  also be attainable, though may require additional amplification cycles. Single positive
  samples can be detected when pooling either after or prior to RNA extraction. CONCLUSIONS:
  As it uses the standard protocols, reagents and equipment, this pooling method can
  be applied immediately in current clinical testing laboratories. We hope that such
  implementation of a pool test for COVID-19 would allow expanding current screening
  capacities thereby enabling the expansion of detection in the community, as well
  as in close organic groups, such as hospital departments, army units, or factory
  shifts.'
